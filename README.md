Building AI Course Project - Detecting Strategic Anomalies in Online Poker
Summary:
This project aims to develop an AI system that analyzes poker gameplay data to detect anomalies in player strategies, particularly during betting rounds. The system will be designed to flag players whose betting patterns or card-play decisions deviate suspiciously from the statistical norm, potentially indicating cheating or collusion.

Background:
Since the rise of online poker platforms, such as PokerStars and 888poker, detecting unfair play, such as collusion or the use of bots, has been a major concern. Many platforms have manual or rudimentary systems in place to detect cheaters, but AI can offer a more advanced solution to flag suspicious betting behavior.

In traditional poker, cheating is often limited due to physical oversight, but in online poker, such direct control is impossible. This AI project will use historical online poker game data to train models that identify unusual betting patterns or card-play strategies. The system will not only help detect potential cheaters but could also be used by professionals to gain insights into advanced player strategies.

How is it used?

	1.	Training and Testing:
Analysts will first train the AI using historical game data from online poker platforms, focusing on “clean” datasets where known cheaters have already been excluded. The AI will learn typical betting behaviors and strategy choices across different player profiles.
	2.	Real-time Use:
Once trained, the AI system can monitor ongoing poker games in real-time, identifying players whose betting or play style significantly deviates from the learned norms.
	3.	Further Investigation:
If flagged patterns persist, an analyst can investigate whether the anomalies are due to cheating, bots, or other unfair advantages like collusion between players.

Data Sources and AI Methods:

	•	Data Sources:
Historical online poker game data, including details of each hand, betting rounds, player actions, and outcomes. Data from previously identified cheaters will be excluded to train the model on normal behavior.
	•	AI Methods:
Machine learning models will be used to identify anomalies in player behavior, with special attention to patterns in betting that seem statistically irregular or overly optimized (as often seen with bots or colluders).

Challenges:

	•	Detecting Cheating:
The AI will not directly identify cheaters but will help analysts by flagging suspicious behaviors that require further manual investigation.
	•	Complexity of Poker:
Poker involves complex decision-making, and some strategies that appear anomalous may just be advanced play. The AI will need to distinguish between these situations to avoid false positives.

What’s Next?
The AI could be expanded to work across multiple online poker platforms, offering a faster and more effective way to detect potential cheating or bot usage. Additionally, professional players could use the tool to analyze high-level strategies and improve their own gameplay.
